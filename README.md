# OSM Local Food Producers – County Level Extraction

This project extracts **local food producers, markets, farms, and processors**
from **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** for a **specific U.S. county**, using the
**Overpass API** and **GeoPandas**.

The output is a clean, county-clipped **GeoJSON** file ready for use in **QGIS**
or further spatial analysis.

## 📌 Features

- County-based spatial filtering using official county boundaries
- OSM data extraction via Overpass API
- Supports nodes and ways (using centroids)
- Clean GeoJSON output
- CRS-safe workflow (EPSG:4326)
- QGIS-ready visualization

Install dependencies:

pip install geopandas requests shapely fiona pyproj
▶️ How It Works
Loads a county boundary GeoJSON

Reprojects boundary to EPSG:4326

Extracts bounding box for Overpass query

Queries OSM for:

Farms

Markets

Food producers

Processors

Converts results to GeoDataFrame

Spatially filters features inside the county

Exports GeoJSON

🚀 Usage
python scripts/extract_osm_producers.py
Output file:

data/processed/osm_producers.geojson
🗺 Visualizing in QGIS
Open QGIS

Drag osm_producers.geojson into the map

Set project CRS to EPSG:3857 or EPSG:3083

Use Identify Features to inspect attributes

📤 Output Fields
osm_id

name

shop

amenity

craft

industrial

products

organic

delivery

website

phone

geometry

⚠️ Notes
Overpass queries use bounding boxes for performance

Final spatial filtering ensures county-only results

Large counties may require query simplification

🔮 Future Enhancements
Polygon-based Overpass queries

Multi-county batch processing

Data classification by producer type

Web map integration

CLI arguments
